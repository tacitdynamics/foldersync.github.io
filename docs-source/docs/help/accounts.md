# What is an account

An account is used to access a cloud service or file server, in order to be able to sync files from it to the device.

One of the first things you probably want to do is therefore to add an account to use for sync with cloud storage or a server. You will be required to provide your login credentials, either directly in FolderSync or on the provider webpage for those supporting OAuth authentication. If you do not already have an cloud service account you can create one at the applicable vendor website.

You can add an account on account screen or directly from the dashboard by pressing [Add] button on Account card.
