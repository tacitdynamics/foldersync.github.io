# Getting started

FolderSync is, as the name suggests, a folder syncing application. It is not a traditional backup application, although it can be used to backup files if you configure it correctly. Its primary purpose is to sync folders between your devices and remote cloud provider or a server.

!!! warning

    As mentioned FolderSync can be used to backup files, but it will not retain files if you configure a folderPair to also sync deletion of files. In that case any deletions will be mirrored. Sync deletions is disabled by default, so unless you enable it, FolderSync will never delete files.

# Installation

FolderSync can be installed from Google Play or by installing APK manually. 

Requires Android 6.0 or newer.
