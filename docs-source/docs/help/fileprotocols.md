# Add file protocol account

If you want to use SMB, FTP, SFTP or WebDAV file protocols, you have to set it up on a NAS, server or your home PC - or have access to a already configured server. Explaining how to setup and configuring a server is not in the scope of this help text, but there are many guides on the internet.

!!! info

    For WebDAV access FolderSync only supports HTTPS connections. Unencrypted HTTP is not supported.
