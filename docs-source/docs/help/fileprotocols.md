# Add file protocol account

If you want to use SMB, FTP, SFTP or WebDAV file protocols, you have to set it up on a NAS, server or your home PC - or have access to a already configured server. Explaining how to setup this is not in the scope of this help text. Use Google. :-)

!!! info

    For WebDAV access FolderSync only supports HTTPS connections. Plain HTTP is not supported.
