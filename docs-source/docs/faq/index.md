# General 

## TLS session resumption for FTP
FolderSync doesn't support this, so if using a server like FileZilla you have to disable it in server settings to use Foldersync.

## Syncing files ending with dot (.) fails when uploading to SMB server?
Unfortunately this is an issue with many SMB servers and/or widows, they do not accept files ending with dot. 
The issue is not the missing extension, but the ending dot.

## I can not login to my SFTP server
FolderSync uses the sshj library for SFTP. Please ensure your server algorithms are supported and key files are supported.

## I get a "Received message is too long: 1416128878" error with SFTP. Why? 
This seems to be a problem with the server. It responds with something the FolderSync doesn't understand. See detailed answer below:

When I try to use sftp or scp2, I get a message like this: 
Received message too long (or "Bad packet length") 1416586337 
and the connection fails. What's wrong? 

"In order for this to work, the SSH session must be "clean" â€” that is, it must have on it only information transmitted by the programs at either end. What often happens, though, is that there are statements in either the system or per-user shell startup files on the server (.bashrc,.profile,/etc/csh.cshrc,.login, etc.) which output text messages on login, intended to be read by humans (likefortune,echo "Hi there!", etc.). Such code should only produce output on interactive logins, when there is a tty attached to standard input. If it does not make this test, it will insert these text messages where they don't belong: in this case, polluting the protocol stream between scp2/sftp and sftp-server. The first four bytes of the text gets interpreted as a 32-bit packet length, which will usually be a wildly large number, provoking the error message above"

So you need to modify the SFTP server in some way, so that it doesn't send back plain text.

## Login with private key file doesnt work
Please ensure file is in one of the following formats: pkcs5, pkcs8, openssh-key-v1, ssh-rsa-cert-v01@openssh.com, ssh-dsa-cert-v01@openssh.com

## Why are my transfer speeds slow?
Transfer speeds can be slow for many reasons and can vary from device to device. FTPS/SFTP speeds can potentially be increased by disabling compression, since this limits how much data can be sent by how fast the CPU can compress the data. The speed of the memory card can also influence transfer speeds of course.
Transfer speeds have been compared to other popular file managers and they are comparable on the devices we test on, but we are aware that users on some device experience lower speeds.

## Why can't FolderSync be moved to the SD card?
Unfortunately this feature will not be enabled, since it can cause scheduled syncs not to work and then a lot of users will probably complain. :-) However, if you have a rooted phone you can use this tool to move any app to SD:

Just as long as you know that doing so may cause scheduled syncs not to work correctly.

## How do I use Tasker to run a sync in FolderSync?
First of all the full version is required. The full version works as a Tasker plugin - when you configure a new task in Tasker you are presented with a number of Action categories, one of these being "Plugin". Select this and then select "FolderSync" plugin action. Then press edit and select the folderpair you wish to start syncing with this task is executed by Tasker. Then save the task as you normally would in Tasker. For a more general introduction to tasker go here:

## HTTPS connection errors
This can happen on newer Android devices, since deprecated encryption ciphers are no longer enabled by default with OkHttp/Android to increase security. This means, if you are connecting to an insecure web server using WebDAV or ownCloud, the connection may fail. You can either upgrade your server or try to enable self-signed certificates for you WebDAV/ownCloud account. See here which protocols/ciphers are supported on which Android versions: [https://developer.android.com/reference/javax/net/ssl/SSLEngine.htm](https://developer.android.com/reference/javax/net/ssl/SSLEngine.htm)

## How do I fix getting stuck on web page when trying to authenticate account?
When using external browser or custom Chrome tab to authenticate Google Drive or other OAuth supported cloud providers some can get stuck on the web page that gets redirected to. The cause of this is the app is not opened as it should when the https://www.tacit.dk/oauth-return url is loaded. To remedy this please ensure you are using Chrome as your default browser and it is the latest version. Also try to clear defaults for Chrome if still not working.

## How can I access internal SD card, external SD card and USB OTG drive?
To be able to access internal and external SD card, USB OTG and Android/data folder the the necessary permissions must be granted to the app. You do this on the permissions screen that can be opened on about page (right-most option in the bottom menu). It will display which permissions are required by the app and the status of these - and most importantly give you an option to grant the permissions, if they are missing. 

Its also important to note, that if you change your SD card, you must regrant permissions for that SD card to FolderSync or the new SD card won't have write access. You must do this everytime you change SD card, no matter if a SD card has been previously granted permissions. If you decided FolderSync should no longer have write access to external SD card, you can revoke its permissions in settings.
