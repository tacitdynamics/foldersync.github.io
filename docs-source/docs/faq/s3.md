# Amazon S3

## Why do I get sync errors when my Amazon S3 bucket name has a period in it?
Unfortunately bucket names with periods (.) in them is no longer supported by the Amazon API. This is because it results in SSL certificate errors when the Amazon server is accessed by an url like https://some.bucket.name.s3.amazonaws.com. I recommend the period character is replaced by a dash or other legal domain name character.
